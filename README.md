# Dotfile for Linux Mint 20.2 [i3-gaps]

## A description of what the project is for.
- My first attempt at ricing Linux Mint "Uma" that I use as a daily driver. Inspiration came from https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/ . 
- Kali Linux is my next goal [ for ricing and for cyber security experience :) ] .
